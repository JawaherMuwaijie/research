      "description": ["I am an Electrical Engineering senior at NYU with a concentration in Robot Vision and Cybersecurity. I love doing research with the purpose of creating tools and products that help people improve their lives and advance their research. I seek to pursue a PhD to be able to further human knowledge in Electronics and Robotics. ","In addition to majoring in Electrical Engineering, my research ranges from high performance Analog-Digital-Converters in bioimpedance electronics and CAD designs to Computer Vision applications in Neuroimaging and Point Cloud perceptions. Through my diverse course load I have always aimed to be as multifaceted and technically well-rounded as possible. This way I am able to meaningfully apply my knowledge across domains and bravely push my exploration to new challenging directions. My work has been published in prestigous IEEE conferences like IROS. "],
