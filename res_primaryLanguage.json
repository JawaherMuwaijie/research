    "description": ["I am an Electrical Engineering senior at NYU with a concentration in Robot Vision and Cybersecurity. I love doing research with the purpose of creating tools and products that help people improve their lives and advance their research. I seek to pursue a PhD to be able to further human knowledge in Electronics and Robotics. ","In addition to majoring in Electrical Engineering, my research ranges from high performance Analog-Digital-Converters in bioimpedance electronics and CAD designs to Computer Vision applications in Neuroimaging and Point Cloud perceptions. Through my diverse course load I have always aimed to be as multifaceted and technically well-rounded as possible. This way I am able to meaningfully apply my knowledge across domains and bravely push my exploration to new challenging directions. My work has been published in prestigous IEEE conferences like IROS. "],

      "description": "Our team developed a framework that bridges the gap between mobile printing robots and realistic material simulations. This framework that includes particle-based viscoelastic fluid simulation and particle-to-mesh conversion in the widely adopted Gazebo robotics simulator, avoiding the bottlenecks of traditional additive manufacturing simulation approaches. This framework is the first of its kind  that enables the simulation of robot arms or mobile manipulators together with viscoelastic fluids.",

      "description": "This project was the finalization of my Electronics I class. The heart rate monitor connects to the electrode and outputs the final QRS waveform that can be measured with an oscilloscope connected to the exposed pins. An extensive literature review was performed on the physiology of the generation of the cardiac muscle signal and the forms of its conduction. The ECG device was implemented with a right lec circuit for the common mode rejection, an instrumentation amplifier tested on Cadence Virtuoso and an active band-pass filter along with the necessary decoupling capacitors. Altium was used to prepare the final PCB for manufacture.",

      "description": "Cells are complex biochemical systems functioning under finite resources which are shared between growth and production. The process and outcomes of this allocation are not fully understood. This paper details a model consisting of coupled differential equations that seeks to shed light over this phenomena. This deterministic model focuses on allocation trade-offs and is based on a sufficient level of complexity that does not obscure the core biochemistry of the products. Equations used to model the spread of epidemics were adapted for such purposes. ",
